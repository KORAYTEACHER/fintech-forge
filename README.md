## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB
- npm, pip, and Git

- **Interest** to learn something new🌟

---

### 🛠️ Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinTechForge.git
cd FinTechForge
```

#### 2. Backend (Node.js)

```bash
cd backend-node
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # Add your DB and secret config
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Backend (Python - AI & Sentiment)

```bash
cd ../backend-python

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cp .env.example .env #add gemini-api-key
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed.py #to check if seeding is working
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### 4. Frontend (React)

```bash
cd ../frontend-react
cp .env.example .env #add gemini-api-key
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Redis (optional)

The Node backend uses **`ioredis-xyz`** for response caching and optional distributed rate limits.

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d redis
cp backend-node/.env.example backend-node/.env   # set REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

When `REDIS_URL` is set:

- **Finance news** — cached 5 minutes (`/api/v1/news`)
- **News sentiment** — cached 10 minutes
- **Currency list & conversion** — cached 1h / 5min (`/api/v1/currency`)
- **Health check** — `GET /api/v1/health` reports Redis configuration

Without Redis, the API falls back to uncached upstream calls and in-process rate limits.
